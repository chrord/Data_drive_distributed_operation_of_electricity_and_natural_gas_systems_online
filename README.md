# Data-driven Distributed Operation of Electricity and Natural Gas Systems
Electronic companion for the research paper "Data-driven Distributed Operation of Electricity and Natural Gas Systems"
This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper "Data-driven Distributed Operation of Electricity and Natural Gas Systems". 
This is joint work by Christos Ordoudis and Viet Anh Nguyen. Christos Ordoudis is funded by the Danish
Strategic Research Council (DSF) through project “CITIES”, No. 1305-00027B/DSF.

In this repository, we provide:
   1. The source code implemented in Matlab using YALMIP.
   2. The xlsx file that containts the data of the case study.
   
## Source code and mat files
The source code is implemented in Matlab using YALMIP. The main file runs with the help of src codes. The optimization problems for DRCC and GCC approximation, as well as the real-time optimal power and natural gas flow are given in different folders. Additionally, we provide all the data used for the test-case and wind power.

## Data file
This file contains the data for the power and natural gas producers, as well as for the electricity and natural gas network. The topology of the systems is also illustrated.
